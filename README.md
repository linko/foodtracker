# Food Tracker

The idea behind the app is to allow people to quickly log their weight and what they eat every day. In itâ€™s simplest form this app is like a simple blog with categories for meals, weight and Exercise.

#### Design
Use Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

#### API
All of these items need to be available as a REST JSON API. (There is an iPhone App people can use to post items from)
